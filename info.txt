To make this app work you will need to create a postgres server (use docker) once the server is created crete new role/user accordingly per the server connection configurations in functions.php. Once the database and user/role is created you can manually run the db.sql code in the docker terminal cli (copy and paste).  This will create the tables and viola!  to run the php server, just open the terminal inside the project and type 'php -S localhost:4001
